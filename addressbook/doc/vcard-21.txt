Section 1 : Introduction
[DS2]          
Personal Data Interchange (PDI) occurs every time two or more 
individuals communicate, in either a business or personal context, 
face-to-face, or across space and time. Such interchanges frequently 
include the exchange of informal information, such as business cards, 
telephone numbers, addresses, dates and times of appointments, etc. 
Augmenting PDI with electronics and telecommunications can help ensure 
that information is quickly and reliably communicated, stored, 
organized and easily located when needed.
Personal information, by nature, is complex and diverse. Currently, 
proprietary standards exist to structure some types of PDI 
information, but no single, open specification comprehensively 
addresses the needs of collecting and communicating PDI information 
across many common communication channels such as telephones, voice-
mail, e-mail, and face-to-face meetings. versit  is developing a 
comprehensive family of PDI technologies based on open specifications 
and interoperability agreements to help meet this technology need.
Overview
This specification defines a format for an electronic business card, 
or vCard. The format is suitable as an interchange format between 
applications or systems. The format is defined independent of the 
particular method used to transport it. The transport for this 
exchange might be a file system, point-to-point asynchronous 
communication, wired-network transport, or some form of unwired 
transport.
A vCard is a data stream consisting of one or more vCard objects. The 
individual vCard definitions can be identified and parsed within the 
datastream. The vCard data stream may exist as a persistent form in a 
file system, document management system, network connection between 
two network endpoints, or in any other digital transport that has an 
abstraction of a stream of bytes.
Conceptually, a vCard Writer creates vCard data streams and a vCard 
Reader interprets vCard data streams. The vCard Reader and Writer may 
be implemented as a single application or as separate applications. It 
is not the intent of this specification to define the implementation 
of these processes beyond some fundamental capabilities related to the 
format of the vCard data stream and a common set of conformance 
requirements .
This specification provides for a clear-text encoding that is intended 
to be based on the syntax used by the MIME specification (RFC 1521).
The encoding of this specification can be used in environments which 
are constrained to 7-bit transfer encodings, short line lengths, and 
low bandwidth. In addition, the encoding is simple in order to 
facilitate the implementation of reader and writer applications on 
small platforms, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), cellular 
telephones, or alphanumeric pagers.
Scope
The vCard is intended to be used for exchanging information about 
people and resources. In today's business environment, this 
information is typically exchanged on business cards. It is 
appropriate, then that this specification define this information in 
terms of a paradigm based on an electronic business card object.
The ultimate destination for this information is often a collection of 
business cards, Rolodex® file, or electronic contact manager. Prior to 
the introduction of the vCard specification, users of such 
applications typically had to re-key the original information, often 
transcribing it from paper business cards. With the advent of the 
vCard specification, this information can be exchanged in an automated 
fashion.
The basis for the data types supported by this specification have 
their origin in openly defined, international standards and in 
additional capabilities based on enhancements suggested by the 
demonstration of the exchange of prototypical vCards using the 
Internet based World-Wide-Web, Infra-red data transport, and 
simultaneous voice and data (SVD) modems.
The "person" object defined by the CCITT X.500 Series Recommendation 
for Directory Services was the primary reference for the properties 
that are defined by this specification. Every attempt was made to make 
it possible to map the X.520/X.521 attributes and objects into and out 
of an instance of a vCard. The vCard specification has extended the 
capabilities that have been defined within the CCITT X.500 Series 
Recommendation to allow the exchange of additional information often 
recorded on business cards and electronic contact managers. For 
example, this specification provides support for exchanging graphic 
images representing company logos, photographs of individuals, geo-
positioning information, and other extensions to properties defined by 
the X.500 Recommendation.
The specification of all date and time values are defined in terms of 
the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times. ISO 8601 
supersedes all other international standards defined at the time this 
specification was drafted.
The paradigm of an electronic business card is related to the concepts 
of an entry in a LAN/WAN directory or an electronic mail address book 
or distribution list. However, the requirements of the electronic 
business card go beyond the definitions of a "person" object found in 
either the CCITT X.500 Series Recommendation, network directory 
services, or electronic mail address book products. The vCard 
specification is needed to address the requirements for an interchange 
format for the "person" personal data type or object.
Personal data applications such as Personal Information Managers (PIM) 
often provide an import/export capability using Comma Separated Value 
(CSV) or Tab Delimited Files (TDF) formats. However, these solutions 
do not preserve the intent of the originating application. When a CSV 
and TDF format is used by a PIM, the meta-data or semantics of the 
originating object are only apparent to a similar version of the 
originating application. Exchange of data between such applications is 
another important application of an industry-standard specification 
for an electronic business card interchange format, such as the vCard 
specification.

Section 2 : vCard Specificiation
[DS3]          
This section defines the semantics and syntax for the vCard.
A vCard is a collection of one or more properties. A property is a 
uniquely named value. A set of properties can be grouped within a 
vCard. For example, the properties for a telephone number and comment 
can be grouped in order to preserve the coupling of the annotation 
with the telephone number. In addition to property groupings, a vC. 
versit  is developing a comprehensive family of PDI technologies based 
on open specifications and interoperability agreements to help meet 
this technology need.

The paradigm of an electronic business card is related to the concepts 
of aQuoted-Printable lines of text must also be limited to less than 
76 characters. The 76 characters does not include the CRLF (RFC 822) 
line break sequence. For example a multiple line LABEL property value 
of:
123 Winding Way
Any Town, CA 12345
USA
Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:
LABEL;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:123 Winding Way=0D=0A=
  Any Town, CA 12345=0D=0A=
  USA
Property parameter substrings are delimited by a field delimiter, 
specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-colon 
in a property parameter value must be escaped with a Backslash 
character (ASCII 92).
Compound property values are property values that also make use of the 
Semi-colon, field delimiter to separate positional components of the 
value. For example, the Name property is made up of the Family Name, 
Given Name, etc. components. A Semi-colon in a component of a compound 
property value must be escaped with a Backslash character (ASCII 92).
Grouping
There are two forms of grouping or collections supported within the 
vCard. A collection of vCard objects can be grouped and a collection 
of properties within an individual vCard can be grouped.
vCard Grouping
The vCard data stream can consist of multiple vCard objects. The vCard 
data stream can, sequentially, contain one or more vCard objects.,  In 
addition, the vCard data stream can contain a property whose value is 
a nested vCard. In both of these cases, each vCard object will be 
delimited by the vCard Delimiters. The vCard Reader conforming to this 
specification must be able to parse and process any of these 
combinations of vCard Groupings. The support for vCard Grouping is 
optional for a vCard Writer conforming to this specification.
Property Grouping
A Property Grouping is the definition of a method for specifying a 
collection of related properties within a vCard object. There is no 
requirement on a vCard reader that it preserve the property group 
name. However, the vCard reader is required to preserve the grouping 
of the properties.
The Property Grouping is identified by a character string prefix to 
the property name; separated by the Period character (ASCII decimal 
46).
The grouping of a comment property with a telephone property is shown 
in the following example:
A.TEL;HOME:+1-213-555-1234
A.NOTE:This is my vacation home.
The vCard Reader conforming to this specification must be able to 
parse and process the property grouping. The support for Property 
Grouping is optional for a vCard Writer conforming to this 
specification.
Encodings
The default encoding for the vCard object is 7-Bit. The default 
encoding can be overridden for an individual property value by using 
the "ENCODING" property parameter. This parameter value can be either 
"BASE64", "QUOTED-PRINTABLE", or "8BIT". This parameter may be used on 
any property.
Some transports (e.g., MIME based electronic mail) may also provide an 
encoding property at the transport wrapper level. This property can be 
used in these cases for transporting a vCard data stream that has been 
defined using a default encoding other than 7-bit (e.g., 8-bit).
Character Set
The default character set is ASCII. The default character set can be 
overridden for an individual property value by using the "CHARSET" 
property parameter. This property parameter may be used on any 
property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties may 
not make sense.
Any character set registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers 
Authority (IANA) can be specified by this property parameter. For 
example, ISO 8859-8 or the Latin/Hebrew character set is specified by:
ADR;CHARSET=ISO-8859-8:...
Some transports (e.g., MIME based electronic mail) may also provide a 
character set property at the transport wrapper level. This property 
can be used in these cases for transporting a vCard data stream that 
has been defined using a default character set other than ASCII (e.g., 
UTF-8).
Language
The default language is "en-US" (US English). The default language can 
be overridden for an individual property value by using the "LANGUAGE" 
property parameter. The values for this property are a string 
consistent with RFC 1766, Tags for the Identification of Languages. 
This property parameter may be used on any property. However, the use 
of this parameter on some properties, such as PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND, TEL, 
may not make sense. Canadian French would be specified by this 
parameter by the following:
ADR;LANGUAGE=fr-CA:...
Value Location
The default location of the property value is inline with the 
property. However, for some properties, such as those that specify 
multimedia values, it is efficient to organize the property value as a 
separate entity (e.g., a file out on the network). The property 
parameter "VALUE" can be specified to override the "INLINE" location 
of the property value. In the case of the vCard being transported 
within a MIME email message, the property value can be specified as 
being located in a separate MIME entity with the "Content-ID" value, 
or "CID" for short. In this case, the property value is the Content-ID 
for the MIME entity containing the property value. In addition, the 
property value can be specified as being located out on the network 
within some Internet resource with the "URL" value. In this case, the 
property value is the Uniform Resource Locator for the Internet 
resource containing the property value. This property parameter may be 
used on any property. However, the use of this parameter on some 
properties may not make sense; for example the Version, Time Zone, 
Comment, Unique Identifier, properties . The following specifies a 
value not located inline with the vCard but out in the Internet:
PHOTO;VALUE=URL;TYPE=GIF:http://www.abc.com/dir_photos/my_photo.gif
SOUND;VALUE=CONTENT-ID:<jsmith.part3.960817T083000.xyzMail@host1.com
Binary Values
The vCard format supports inclusion of binary information, such as 
computer graphic images, digital audio, or video graphic images. The 
binary information may either be referenced with a Uniform Reference 
Locator (URL) or  placed inline in the vCard as the value of a 
property. Inline binary information is included as a property value 
after being encoded into clear-text with a Base 64 (default) or 
Quoted-Printable encoding
Identification Properties
These property types are concerned with information associated with 
the identification and naming of the individual or resource associated 
with the vCard object.
Formatted Name
This property specifies the formatted name string associated with the

Telecommunications Addressing Properties
These property types are concerned with information associated with 
the telecommunications addressing of the vCard object.
Telephone Number
This property specifies the canonical number string for a telephone 
number for telephony communication with the vCard object. The value of 
this property is specified in a canonical form in order to specify an 
unambiguous representation of the globally unique telephony endpoint. 
This property is based on the X.520 Telephone Number attribute.
The canonical form cannot be dialed without first being transformed by 
a dialing algorithm. The dialing algorithm combines the canonical 
number string with knowledge of the local dialing procedures, in 
effect at the time of call placement to produce actual dialing 
instructions. The actual dialing algorithm is outside the scope of 
this specification.
Two important canonical forms allowed by this specification are:
*    Apple Computer's Representation of a Canonical Static DeviceID in 
The Telephony Suite, version 1.0,
*    Microsoft TAPI in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Telephony 
Programmer's Guide, version 1.0.
Software which creates this property can store a string in these 
allowed formats. Dialing software should be prepared to parse numbers 
from either of the supported formats; as neither format is considered 
to be technically costly to support.
This property is identified by the property name TEL. An example of 
this property follows:
TEL;PREF;WORK;MSG;FAX:+1-800-555-1234
Support for this property is optional for vCard Writers conforming to

this property is optional for vCard Writers conforming to this 
specification. An example of this property follows:
MAILER:ccMail 2.2
Geographical Properties
These property types are concerned with geographical positions or 
region information associated with the vCard object.
Time Zone
This property specifies information related to the standard time zone 
of the vCard object. The time zone is a string as specified in a 
manner consistent with ISO 8601. It is an offset from Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC). An ISO 8601 UTC offset, in basic format, is 
specified as a positive or negative difference in units of hours and 
minutes (e.g., +hhmm). If minutes are zero, then they may be omitted 
and the format would be specified in units of hours (e.g., +hh). The 
time is specified as a 24-hour clock. Hour valult property parameter 
is overridden to some other set of values by specifying one or more 
alternate values. For example, the default of a delivery for INTL, 
WORK, POSTAL and PARCEL can be reset to DOM, POSTAL, WORK and HOME in 
the following example:
ADR;DOM;WORK;HOME;POSTAL:P.O. Box 101;;;Any Town;CA;91921-1234;
Delivery Label
This property specifies the addressing label for physical delivery to 
the person/object associated with the vCard. The property is intended 
to include the information necessary to create a formatted delivery 
address label. Typical information includes the name, street address, 
possibly a Post Office or mail drop, city, state or province, zip or 
postal code. An international delivery label would also include the 
country name. 
This property is based on the semantics of the X.520 Postal Address 
attribute. This specification has added semantics to those defined by 
the X.500 Series standard for differentiating Home, Work, Parcel, 
Postal, Domestic, and International delivery label types.
This property is identified by the property name LABEL. This property 
specifies the formatted delivery address label for the vCard object.

Telecommunications Addressing Properties
These property types are concerned with information associated with 
the telecommunications addressing of the vCard object.
Telephone Number
This property specifies the canonical number string for a telephone 
number for telephony communication with the vCard object. The value of 
this property is specified in a canonical form in order to specify an 
unambiguous representation of the globally unique telephony endpoint. 
This property is based on the X.520 Telephone Number attribute.
The canonical form cannot be dialed without first being transformed by 
a dialing algorithm. The dialing algorithm combines the canonical

Agent
This property specifies information about another person who will act 
on behalf of the vCard object. Typically this would be an area 
administrator, assistant, or secretary for the individual. A key 
characteristic of the Agent property is that it represents somebody or 
something which is separately addressable. For example, if all phone 
calls or e-mail messages are normally screened by an agent, this 
property may not be needed. On the other hand, if an agent can act as 
a proxy, and may otherwise need to be contacted separately, then an 
Agent property is useful.
This property is equivalent to nesting another vCard with the 
specified vCard.
This property is identified by the property name AGENT. The value of 
this property is a string containing another vCard object. An example 
of this property follows:
AGENT:

Unit attribute. For example, "The AB Corporation" and the "North 
American Division".
This property is identified by the property name ORG. This property is 
defined to encapsulate the Organization Name and Organization Unit 
properties as sub-properties. The property value consists of the 
components of the organization specified as positional fields 
separated by the Field Delimiter (ASCII decimal 59). The property 
value is a concatenation of the Organization Name (first field), 
Organizational Unit (second field) strings. Additional positional 
fields, if specified, contain additional Organizational Units. The 
following is an example of the Organization property:
ORG:ABC, Inc.;North American Division;Marketing
Support for this property is optional for vCard Writers conforming to 
this specification.
Explanatory Properties
These property types are concerned with additional explanations, such 
as that related to national language support, annotation, or encoding 
of binary information about the vCard object.

Miscellaneous Properties
Extensions
The vCard provides a ?standard mechanism for doing non-standard 
things?. This extension support is provided for implementers to "push 
the envelope" on the existing version of the specification. Extension 
properties are specified by property and/or property parameter names 
that have the initial sub-string of X- (the two character sequence: 
Capital X character followed by the Dash character. It is recommended 
that vendors concatenate onto this sentinel an added short sub-string 
to identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the 
extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different 
vendors. For example, the following might be the ABC vendor's 
extension for a video-clip form of identification property:
X-ABC-VIDEO;MPEG2:http://lonestar.bubbas.org/billibob.mpg
or, the following example might be an extension for grouping vCard 
objects into a distribution list for the Design Work Group.

At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension 
properties.
Support for this property is mandatory for implementations conforming 
to this specification. However, an implementation may not be able to 
act on the extension property. Conformance only requires that an 
implementation be able to parse vCard data streams with extensions. 
The implementation need not act on them.
Formal Definition
The following modified Backus-Naur Notation (BNF) is provided to 
assist developers in building parsers for the vCard.
This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC 822, but 
it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

  LF           =  <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (     12,      10.)

Section 3 : Internet Recommendations
[DS4]     1    
Recommended Practice with SMTP/MIME
The vCard information can be transported through SMTP/MIME based 
electronic mail services. Interoperability of vCard information over 
SMTP/MIME transports can be better assured by following a common set 
of recommended practices for encapsulation of the vCard.
Text/Plain Content Type
Without any change to existing SMTP or MIME compliant user agents, a 
vCard can be included within Internet email messages. This might be 
the case for an existing, simple user agent such as a legacy SMTP mail 
system. While this approach provides for transport of vCards over SMTP 
services, it does not allow for the end user to take advantage of the 
full capabilities of either the vCard or Internet email (i.e., MIME) 
functionality.
The following demonstrates how a vCard can be included as an epilog to 
a SMTP message made up of a RFC 822 message. This may be an initial 
method for incorporating vCard objects into SMTP messages.

Text/X-vCard Content Type
A vCard object may also be transferred in a (RFC 1521) MIME entity as 
a non-standard "text/x-vCard" content-type. This (RFC 1521) MIME type 
maybe useful in those cases where the MIME compliant messaging service 
does not yet support the "application/directory" and 
"multipart/related" MIME content-types and yet the specificity of a 
calendaring and scheduling media type is required.

Application/Directory Content Type
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Access and Searching of 
Internet Directories (ASID) working group has produced an Internet 
Draft defining the "application/directory" MIME content type. The 
current draft name is draft-ietf-asid-mime-direct-01.txt. This 
specification is intended to be aligned with this work. Internet 
Drafts are working documents of an IETF working group, valid for at 
most six months, and should be considered "works in progress". 
This MIME content type was designed to be used to transport directory 
information across MIME based electronic mail services. The internet 
draft is directly applicable to the exchange of business card data, 
such as that defined by the vCard specification.
The versit PDI Team has worked within the IETF ASID Working Group to 
draft an application/directory profile that registers the method for 
transporting a vCard as an application/directory Content-Type. The 
current draft name is draft-ietf-asid-mime-vcard-00.txt. This work is 
expected to be progressed to a Request For Comment after the 
publication of this version of the vCard specification. In the 
interim, the following guidelines are provided to describe how a vCard 
might be conveyed using the application/directory draft specification.
A vCard should be included in a MIME message that has a Content-Type 
header field value of "multipart/related". The vCard is included in 
the message as the primary body part. The position of the body part 
entity can also be specified with the "start=" parameter. This MIME 
body part entity has a Content-Type body part header field value of 
"application/directory" with a "profile" parameter value of "vcard". 
Any vCard binary information, such as a logo, picture, or digital 
audio pronunciation can be included inline within the vCard, as is 
specified by the vCard specification. Preferably, the binary 
information should be extracted from the vCard object and contained in 
the MIME message as secondary body part entities. The binary content 
in the secondary body part entities can be referenced from within the 
vCard object through the use of the "VALUE=" property parameter. In 
this latter case, the binary information should be transformed into a 
content type nominally supported by MIME user agents. For image 
content, this would be the Graphics Image Format (GIF) or Joint 
Picture Encoding Group (JPEG) formats. For audio content, this would 
be the 8-bit mu-law (PCM) format specified by the MIME specification.
The following example defines how this might be specified:

Recommended Practice with HTTP/HTML
A vCard object should be transferred over HTTP with the non-standard  
MIME type/subtype value of "text/x-vCard". The non-standard subtype 
should be used because the vCard has not been registered as a MIME 
media type with the IANA.
The vCard information can be captured with a FORM type of HTML 
document. Interoperability of of vCard information can be better 
assured by following a common set of recommended practices for mapping 
vCard information into and out of HTML documents.
Form Element Usage
The HTML FORM element is a useful method for capturing data intended 
for input into individual vCard property values. The following 
recommended practices are provided for such use.
Mapping To INPUT Element Attribute Names
An HTML form data set is a useful mechanism for capturing vCard data 
within the Internet WWW. The use of a consistent naming scheme for the 
name attributes within a form element will permit implementations to 
support automatic fill-in of forms with existing vCard data. In 
addition, such a consistent naming scheme will provide a greater 
assurance of interoperability between HTML based applications that use 
vCard data.
The following table provides a recommended mapping of vCard properties 
and name attributes within a form element.
