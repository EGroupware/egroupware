egroupware-epl (9.2.20100212-1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Calendar: database UPDATE
  *   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL SYNCML USERS. PLEASE READ!
  *   All users who sync their devices with SyncML have to be aware that an
  *   "initial sync" will be necessary on any synced device directly after the
  *   next update of an EGroupware instance.
  *   GroupDAV devices should be updated automatically and there are no
  *   further things to do for GroupDAV devices.
  *   Which updates are affected?
  *   Updates from EPL9.1 Packages to current EPL9.2 released after 11.th Feb.2010
  *   Updates from EPL9.2 Packages prior to 11.th Feb. 2010 to current EPL9.2
  *   released after 11.th Feb. 2010
  *   Updates from any official version <= 1.6.002
  *   - to future 1.6.003
  *   - to current SVN versions [branch (Revision 29097) or trunk (Revision 29096)]
  *   Updates from any SVN version
  *   - to current SVN versions [branch (Revision 29097) or trunk (Revision 29096)]
  *   Reason:
  *   In current EGroupware versions (<= 1.6002) we did not fully match the
  *   iCal RFC on calendar entries. This caused some hard to resolve problems
  *   for syncing the calendar entries. With the next update we change the
  *   contents of the calendar's UID and RECURRENCE-ID database fields to fit
  *   the iCal RFC.
  *   Here's some advice on performing the next EGroupware update:
  *   - let your SyncML users perform a last sync before EGroupware gets updated
  *   - tell your users to not change any entries on the sync devices until
  *   the update is finished
  *   - after the update, let your users perform an "initial sync" on every
  *   device; this means to let the sync remove all the contents on the device
  *   and refresh it with the server data; this can be done by a setting on
  *   your device
