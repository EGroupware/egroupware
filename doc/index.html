<h2>Dedication </h2>

<p>
Thanks to Joesph Engo for starting phpGroupWare (at the time called
webdistro) and the core of this HOWTO. Thanks to all the developers
and users who contribute to making phpGroupWare such a success. 

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is phpGroupWare </h2>

<p>
phpGroupWare is a web based GroupWare system. It comes with serveral
core apps for email, calendar, todo list, address book, file manager,
and a notepad.

<p>
It also provides a framework for add-on applications to integrate
seamlessly in phpGroupWare. Some samples are a bookmark manager, a
trouble ticket system, a weather reporter, a phone log, a chat program,
and a forum system. There are many more in development, and you can
develop your own as well. 

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why you should use it </h2>

<p>
You should use it if you would like a powerful groupware system that
can be access from anywhere on the Internet, and allows for custom
add-ons. For companies with a distributed user base, it's an ideal
solution. Oh, and did I mention that its FREE? 

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</h2>

<p>
Installation and Configuration of phpGroupWare has never been easier.
Just point and click, yeah it's very easy.

<p>
Since this is still a beta version we do expect some bugs. By carefully
reading this document you can easly install phpGroupWare. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements </h3>

<p>
You will need PHP compiled and installed on your system. You will
also need MySQL or PostgreSQL setup. If you are planning on using
the email system, you will need to have an IMAP server installed and
IMAP support compiled into PHP. You can have it installed as an Apache
module or command line version, the Apache module is preferred. We
will assume that you are running on a Linux or other Unix system for
these steps. Windows is supported, but there is no documentation for
it currently. 

<p>
In order to check if you have php installed create the file with your
favorite text editor named test.php in your webserver root directory:

<p>
<tt>&lt;? phpinfo(); ?&#62;</tt>

<p>
Then point your browser to http://yourserverroot/test.php. You should
get a very detailed page describing various options in php.

<p>
If you need to to compile php and apache the following links are good
starting points: 

<p>
A set of scripts to compile and install various modules with apache:
<a href="http://www.apachetoolbox.com"><tt>http://www.apachetoolbox.com</tt></a>

<p>
The Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) Guide v2 (latest as of this writing):
<a href="http://www.linuxhelp.net/guides/"><tt>http://www.linuxhelp.net/guides/</tt></a>

<p>
The Soothing Seemless Setup of Apache, SSL, MySQL, and PHP: <a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/SoothinglySeamless"><tt>http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/SoothinglySeamless</tt></a>

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">
3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested Systems </h3>

<p>
On Linux 2.2.x, 2.4.x

<p>
PHP 3.0.15+ / PHP 4.0.x

<p>
Apache 1.3.x

<p>
MySQL 3.22.25 or PostgreSQL 7.0.x

<p>
Courier-IMAP 0.33+ and/or qmail 1.03 for POP3 access

<p>
We have reports of it working on Windows NT and OS/2, and using Oracle
as the database. 

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining and Installing phpGroupWare </h2>

<p>
After you have met the system requirements, You can install it from
the TarBall or you can get it directly from CVS. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing from TarBall </h3>

<p>
Installing from a TarBall is very easy. The files should be installed
in the webserver directory. Example steps (please adjust to your servers
config):

<p>
cp phpgroupware-version.tar.gz /home/httpd/html

<p>
cd /home/httpd/html

<p>
tar zxf phpgroupware-version.tar.gz

<p>
You may have to get required permissions to do this. Contact your
system administrator if you dont have the permission to write to your
webserver directory.

<p>
You can get current releases of phpGroupWare at the phpGroupware <em>website</em>
(<a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/downloads.php"><tt>http://www.phpgroupware.org/downloads.php</tt></a>). 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing from CVS </h3>

<p>
Installing from a CVS is fairly easy. The files should be checked
out in the webserver directory. Example steps (please adjust to your
servers config):

<p>
cd /home/httpd/html

<p>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpgroupware
login (just hit enter if prompted for a password)

<p>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpgroupware
co phpgroupware

<p>
or if you prefer using CVSROOT:

<p>
export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpgroupware'

<p>
cvs login (just hit enter if prompted for a password)

<p>
cvs co phpgroupware

<p>
You may have to get required permissions to do this. Contact your
system administrator if you dont have the permission to write to your
webserver directory. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting File Permissions </h3>

<p>
There are a few directories which will need special fie permissions
set for phpGroupWare to work properly.

<p>
Temp Directory (Required) - This can be /tmp for simplicity, but it
is required for several apps to function properly. Simply make sure
that the webserver can add/delete files in it.

<p>
Files Directory (Required) - This can be should be the files dir under
the phpgroupware dir. You will need to give the webserver account
owndership of this directory.

<p>
chown nobody:nobody

<p>
chmod 700 /home/httpd/html/phpgroupware/files

<p>
Root Directory (Not recommended) - If you give the webserver account
write access to the phpgroupware directory, then the setup program
can create the header.inc.php for you. Otherwise you will need to
use the setup program to create it, and then you can manually save
it to file.

<p>
If you want to do it:

<p>
chown :nobody /home/httpd/html/phpgroupware

<p>
chmod 770

<p>
You may have to get required permissions to do this. Contact your
system administrator if you dont have the permission to write to your
webserver directory. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.4">
4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup the database</h3>

<p>
You need to create empty databases for the setup app to create the
tables in.

<p>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc4.4.1">
4.4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysql (assuming an existing and working Mysql install)</h4>

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> Mandrake or Redhat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld start</li>
<p>
<li> other: /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld &amp;</li>
<p>
<li> create the empty database: mysqldadmin -u someuser create phpgroupware
-p</li>
<p>
<li> login to mysql: mysql -u someuser -p</li>
<p>
<li> issue the following at the mysql prompt:</li>
<p>
<li> grant all on phpgroupware.* to phpgroupware@localhost identified
by ``somepassword'';</li>
</ul>
For more detailed user documentation on Mysql see their website :
<a href="http://www.mysql.com"><tt>http://www.mysql.com</tt></a>

<p>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc4.4.2">
4.4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Postgresql (assuming an existing and working Postgresql install)</h4>

<p>
To create the required database in Postgresql make sure postgresql
is started:

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> Mandrake or Redhat : /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql start</li>
<p>
<li> others: /usr/bin/postmaster -D /var/lib/pgsql/data or /usr/bin/pg_ctl
-D /var/lib/pgsq/data start (adjust for your install dirs)</li>
<p>
<li> create the empty database: /usr/bin/createdb phpgroupware</li>
</ul>
For more detailed user documentation on Postgresql see their website
: <a href="http://www.postgresql.org"><tt>http://www.postgresql.org</tt></a>

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.5">
4.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup / Configure phpGroupWare </h3>

<p>
Point your browser to http://yourserverroot/phpgroupware/setup/ which
will create (or upgrade) the header.inc.php and database tables. Setup
will attempt to determine what version of the phpGroupWare databases
and header.inc.php you have installed, and upgrade to the most recent
version. 

<p>
<b>Note:</b>  You are advised to backup your existing database before
running the setup script to avoid problems!

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.6">
4.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing the install </h3>

<p>
If your config is setup properly you can now login. Point your browser
to the installed location and login with the username demo and the
password is 1234

<p>
At this point it would be a good idea to create a new user with administrative
privileges and delete the old one. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.7">
4.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing additional applications </h3>

<p>
Once you have the core phpGroupWare install up and running, you may
want to download and install additional applications.

<p>
You should consult any README or INSTALL files that come with the
new application first, as most require you to create additional tables
in the database, and add additional translation data to the lang table
(typically a file called lang.sql)

<p>
You install the new application within the phpGroupWare install tree
by copying the application directory into the phpGroupWare install
location, and enabling the application through the Administration
page.

<p>
For example, this is the process to install the Headlines application:

<p>
(see <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phpgwapps"><tt>http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phpgwapps</tt></a> for more
applications)

<p>
Download the .tar.gz file for the application, or check out the source
with cvs with

<p>
export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpgwapps'

<p>
cvs login (just hit enter if prompted for a password)

<p>
cvs co headlines

<p>
Move the headlines directory into your phpGroupWare install directory.

<p>
Log into phpGroupWare as an administrative user, and go to the Administration
page.

<p>
In the first section, choose the Applications link.

<p>
Click on add, and fill in the form.

<p>
Application name should be identical to the name of the directory
you moved into the phpGroupWare install, in this case use headlines

<p>
Application Title is shown in the navigation bar and other places
to refer to the new application. Enter Headlines for this example.

<p>
Enabled can be used to disable an application for all users temporially.
You should normal check the box to enable the application.

<p>
Back in the Administration page, you need to enable the application
for specific users or user groups by editing them, and checking the
new Headlines box that appears in the middle of the account editing
page.

<p>
Once you have added the Headlines app to your account, you should
see a Headlines entry in the Administration and Preferences pages,
and there should be an icon for the Headlines application in the navigation
bar.

<p>
Once you enable a few of the Headlines sites through the Administration
page link, you should see headlines grabbed from the sites you selected
when you click on the Headlines icon in the navigation bar. 

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble Shooting</h2>

<p>
<b>Warning </b>

<p>
phpGroupWare is still Beta software, expect some bugs along the way.
If you run into a problem not discussed here, contact us through one
of the methods listed on the website.

<p>
 The phpGroupWare developers can most often be seen hanging out in
<em>#phpGroupWare</em> on <em>irc.openprojects.net</em> if you require
real-time help.

<p>
Also check the FAQ in this directory for additional common questions,
it is available as FAQ.sgml, FAQ.txt and FAQ.html 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to hang when I try to read my mail </h3>

<p>
This is often a problem if you are using POP3 instead of IMAP, and
you have more than a few hundred messages in your mailbox.

<p>
By default, php is set up to time-out a request that takes over 30
seconds to complete. phpGroupWare must do a lot of work the first
time your POP3 mailbox is opened, and every time you get new mail,
which may take more than the 30 second timeout.

<p>
You can either clean up your mailbox with another mail program, or
add the line

<p>
set_time_limit(0);

<p>
to the top of the phpgwapi/inc/phpgw_msg_pop3.inc.php file, just
before the line class msg extends msg_common

<p>
If you choose to edit the file, be patient when loading a large POP3
mailbox - the author tested against a mailbox with 2500 messages in
it, but it took 15 minutes to load the page. We highly suggest you
use IMAP if you expect to have more than a few hundred messages in
your mailbox. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I log in I see the directory listing instead of a web page </h3>

<p>
You are using Apache, this often means you need to add .php to the
DirectoryIndex line in your httpd.conf file. For example:

<p>
DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.cgi 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.3">
5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I get garbage that looks like code when I go to the phpGroupWare
URL </h3>

<p>
This is often because you have php3 installed, which does not map
.php to the PHP engine. For PHP3:

<p>
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php

<p>
For PHP4:

<p>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php
