Steps to set up NTLM Single Sign On for eGroupWare 1.6+
=======================================================
(Version: $Id$)

NTLM SSO removes Windows users on a PC, which is a member of a Windows domain
and who are logged into that domain, from the need to explicitly log into eGW. 
They simply point IE to the eGW URL (eg. http://domain.com/egroupware/) and 
start working. They can of cause explicitly log out and log in as an other user.

Firefox (at least 3.6) requires to manually enable NTLM Auth via about:config:
search for ntlm and set "network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" to the domain
your EGroupware install is using. Otherwise you will only get a popup to enter
username (with prepended windows domain eg. DOMAIN\username) and password.

Here's in short what you need:
-----------------------------
1. eGW 1.6 running on Apache
2. a fully working and configured winbind configuration (not described here)
3. mod_ntlm_winbind (eg. for openSUSE from their package apache2-mod_auth_ntml_winbind)
4. an Apache configuration with the egroupware.conf in this directory (expecting eGW
   to be installed in it's default location /usr/share/egroupware) or port the necessary 
   settings to your Apache configuration. 
   --> You NEED to change the domain from "TEST" to your used domain name!
5. Make the following changes in eGW's setup >> configuraition:
   - HTTP auth types (comma-separated) to use without login-page, eg. "NTLM": NTLM
   - Select which type of authentication you are using: ADS
     This is not needed for NTLM authentication, but allows the users to use their windows
     user and password to log into eGW, if they log in using an other browser or location.
   - Host/IP Domain controler: ... <-- NEED to be filled out
   - Domain name: ... <-- NEED to be filled out, same domain name as above
6. If you use EMail, you have to explicitly specify user/pw to use for contacting the IMAP
   (and SMTP) server, it's no longer available to eGW!

Please note the DC has to be started before you start winbind!

The eGW code should work with every Apache authentication, which sets REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE.
With slight modifications (different var names) it should work eg. with SSL client certificates.
