# EGroupware CalDav/CardDAV and ActiveSync support via .htaccess
#
# Please note:
# - this file needs to be copied as .htaccess to your document root
#   to support CalDAV/CardDAV or ActiveSync synchronisation.
# - your Apache web server needs to be setup to read .htaccess files and
#   allow use of the RewriteEngine directive (AllowOverride FileInfo).
# - you need to replace /egroupware with your EGroupware URL path eg. /egw
# - commented out last directiv can be used to redirect from just the domain to
#   /egroupware/ to facilitate EGroupware login in default subdirectory.
