This directory contains the (unchanged) Version 0.9.3 of jsCalendar

jsCalendar is called by the jscalendar wrapper-class in the phpGW API

Instead of jscalendar-setup.js and a lang/*.js file it loads jscalendar-setup.php,
which sets all jscalendar preferences (partly from the users prefs) and read the
translations from the database for the language the user has spec. in his prefs.
