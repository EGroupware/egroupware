@todo edit and update the IcalSrv client information document.

On this page you will find some first reports on the use of Egroupware and IcalSrv 
with specific clients.

@section secsupfeatures A short note on supported features in the clients

Whether some feature, like e.g. <i>importing recurrent events</i> from
a specific client into Egroupware is supported or not, can in
principle depend on three things: 1) does the client allow setting
this, 2) does egroupware provide a method for setting and using this
and finally 3) is the IcalSrv service capable of converting this
specific info from the client to egw and possibly vice versa?

@subsection secegwexample A small example of a week view in Egroupware
 
In Egroupware I filled a week calendar with
 - E1) a recurring dinner event, every two days,
 - E2) a meeting appointment on monday morning
 - E3) a free day on thursday

\image html egwcalweek-small.jpg The egw calendar filled in weekview

And in Egroupware Infolog I added a Task and a subtask
 - T1 Write a XYZ report and as subtask
 - T2 write chapter 10 of the report

This shows up in egroupware as in the picture below:

@section secko35 Client: Korganizer 3.5.0 (or Kontact)

Korganizer is the KDE agenda and todo client.  I used the 3.5.0
version for most of the testing (so it should work well ;-) )


@subsection subseckorgsetupcal Korganizer: setting up a "remote icalendar".


To access the IcalSrv for Egroupware calendar and tasks, you have to
add a socalled <i>kresource</i> to the resources. You can do this
either via a wizzard or by doing an <i>Add</i>(resource) in the
left-under pane.

The resource must be of the type <i>remote iCalendar</i> and for
reading and writing the same URL should be used. 
When done so, both events and tasks will get imported and exported
from Korganizer via the same kresource.


@subsection subseckorgauth Korganizer: handling Authentication 

To authenticate to the IcalSrv from within korganizer.
you can just set the <i>Download From</i> and <i>Upload To</i>
fields of the created kresource to one and the same URL as something like:
<code>http://myserver.myorg.org/egroupware/icalsrv.php</code>

Later on, when you do a reload or a save, a popup window will appear
that ask you for authentication info. Fill this in and set "remember
info on local computer" or so and your done.


@subsection subseckorgrelopubl Korganizer: Reloading and Publishing

Can be configured  as automatic, time triggered or manual.

.....TBW.......



@subsection seckorgexample Korganizer: week view of the example.  

Korganizer connected via IcalSrv to our example account in Egroupware show us the view below:

\image html korganizerweek-small.jpg Korganizer weekview via the remote icalsrv connected to egroupware.

Notice that:

- the Todos are neatly shown in their hierarchy and with their percentages completed
- the due date of the Todo is shown in the <i>All Day</i> screen
- the whole day event on thursday is correctly shown in the <i>All Day</i> screen.


@subsection seckorgproblems Korganizer: problems

- Korganizer can get its caches confused.
- Korganizer in default setting does a <i>automatic publish </i> immediately after
  each change of an event or todo. This can be costly.

....TBW...



@section secsunbird Client: Sunbird

Sunbird is the standalone calendar application from the Mozilla project.

@subsection secksunbirdexample Sunbird: Week view of the example.

On connecting  Sunbird to our egw account via icalsrv, this gives us
the view below: 

\image html sunbirdweek-small.jpg Sunbird weekview via the remote icalsrv connected to egroupware.

 Notice that:

- the task hierarchy display (task and subtasks) and the percent
  complete is not shown in Sunbird. Merely a list of the induvidual
  tasks. It can though be completely configured to have these  and other
  fields of the tasks shown in the task overview pane.

- the all day event on thursday is present, but due to some bug, it is a bit
  small displayed..

@subsection secsunbirdproblems Sunbird: problems

- In version 0.2+ under Linux I could not publish recurrent events! It seemed that these
  also were not exported correctly to a localfile. Seems like a sunbird bug.

- In version 0.2+ under Linux I could not add new tasks in a subcribed calendar.
  Dont know what is wrong here..

- ..... TBW....

@section secevolution Evolution 2.x

Evolution provides in its 2.x versions utilities to handle calendars
and tasks. For some strange reason it seems that in the versions that
I tried (v2. ??) <b>only reading from remote iCalendars is implemented!</b>

For implementing writing via iCalendar there even seems to be a
pending bounty available... (status: end 2005) Strange if you know
that evo does have a more or less working caldav-plugin..   

@subsection subsecevosetupcal Evolution: setting up a "On The Web Calendar".

Both Calendars and Tasks can be read using, what Evolution calls the
<i>webcal</i>  protocol.
To setup a remote calendar do the following:

 - in calendar pane, on the right mouse button menu select <i> New Calendar</i>
 - chose a Type: <i>On the web</i> and give a name etc. 
   This should now build a new calendar in entry in the calendar pane,
   under the "On The Web" folder.
 - with the right mouse select its menu and select properties. 
   In here you can set the name, color, URL and refresh timings.


@subsection subsecevoauth Evolution: handling Authentication.

You can authenticate to the IcalSrv from within evolution by setting
in the properties field of a (remote) calendar the URL as something like:
<code>webcal://username:passwd@myserver.myorg.org/egroupware/icalsrv.php</code>

I didnot find any other method.

@subsection subsecevosetuptasks Evolution: setting up remote tasks

Setting up task access via IcalSrv is quite analoguous to the "On the
web" calendar setup: 

Go to the Tasks pane, select new tasklist, select "On the Web".
Then via the properties menu of the new "on The Web"-tasklist set the
correct URL again.


@subsection subsecevorelopubl Evolution: Reloading and Publishing

There seems to be no direct manual reload available, though quitting the
application and restarting online work seems to do a reload too.

Automatic (repeatedly after some duration) reloads can be set.



@subsection seckevoexample Evolution: week view of the example.

Evolution connected to our egw example account , gives the view below:

\image html evolutionweek-small.jpg Evolution weekview via the remote icalsrv connected to egroupware.

 Notice that the task hierarchy display (task and subtasks) and the
percentage complete is not available in Evolution. 

@subsection secevoproblems Evolution: problems

@section secfurtherclients Further Clients

...
I hope to get reports of other clients too.



Good luck.
