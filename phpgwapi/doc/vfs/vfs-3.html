<P>These are two functions you'll need to know before we get into
relativity.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:path_parts"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc3.1">path_parts ()</A>
</H2>

<P>The job of path_parts () is to translate any given file location
into its many component parts for any relativity. The values passed
to path_parts () are:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
string
relatives
object
</PRE>
</P>
<P>'string' is the path you want to translate, 'relatives' is the
standard relativity array, and 'object' specifies how you would like
the return value: if 'object' is True, an object will be returned;
if 'object' is False, an array will be returned. I think you'll find
the object easier to deal with, and we'll be using it throughout
this document. The most important returned values (but not all) for
path_parts () are:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
fake_full_path
fake_leading_dirs
fake_extra_path
fake_name
real_full_path
real_leading_dirs
real_extra_path
real_name
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Just like you would think, fake_full_path contains the full virtual
path of 'string', and real_full_path contains the full real path
of 'string'. The fake_name and real_name variables should always
be the same, and contain the final file or directory name. The leading_dirs
contain everything except the name, and the extra_path is everything
from the / before "home" to the end of the leading_dirs. To better
illustrate, here is an example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$p = $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;path_parts (array(
     'string' =&gt; '/home/jason/dir/file',
     'relatives' =&gt; array(
         RELATIVE_NONE
     )
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_full_path - /home/jason/dir/file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_leading_dirs - /home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_extra_path - home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_name - file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_full_path - /var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/jason/dir/file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_leading_dirs - /var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/jason/dir
 </LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_extra_path - home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_name - file</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see, path_parts () is a very useful function and will
save you from doing those darn substr ()'s yourself. For those of
you used to the prior VFS, note that <EM>getabsolutepath () is depreciated</EM>.
getabsolutepath () still exists (albeit in a much different form),
and is responsible for some of the path translation, but it is an
<EM>internal</EM> function only. Applications should only use path_parts ().
We have shown you how to use path_parts () so you can experiment
with it using different paths and relativities as we explore relativity.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:cd"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc3.2">cd ()</A>
</H2>

<P>Part of the overall goal for the VFS in phpGroupWare is to give
the user a seamless experience during their session. For example,
if they upload a file using a file manager to the directory /home/my_group/project1,
and then go to download an email attachment, the default directory
will be /home/my_group/project1. This is accomplished using the cd
() function. Examples: </P>
<P>
<PRE>
/* cd to their home directory */
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd (array(
     'string' =&gt; '/'
));

/* cd to /home/jason/dir */
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd (array(
     'string' =&gt; '/home/jason/dir',
     'relative' =&gt; False,
     'relatives' =&gt; array(
          RELATIVE_NONE
     )
));

/* When following the above, cd's to /home/jason/dir/dir2 */
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd (array(
     'string' =&gt; 'dir2',
     'relative' =&gt; True
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If 'relative' is True, the 'string' is simply appended to the
current path. If you want to know what the current path is, use $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;pwd
().</P>
<P>Now you're ready for relativity.</P>
