   IDOTS TEMPLATE SET FOR eGroupWare

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The template set idots, formaly known as MYiDOTS is 
havely based on the Crystal Icon theme from 
Everaldo. 

   APPLICATION ICONS 
===================================================
Because of a bug in Internet Explorer which causes 
it to display transpancy in PNG's as black I gave 
all icons a background.

Everybody is encouraged to make more icons for the 
idots template set. Please don't use gif as Image
type because this filetype in not an open standard

The source Gimp-files can be found in 
phpgwapi/templates/idots/source/

The logo source file can also be found in the above
directory.

   APPLICATION HOOKS
===================================================
In the hook_file, hook_sidebox_menu.inc.php, 
developers can define the sidebox menu's for their 
applications template hook files can be found in 
phpgwapi/templates/idots/hook_templates/


Hope you enjoy this template set,
