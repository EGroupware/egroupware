In EgwIcal the timed data of Egroupware like events and tasks get
converted to elements for an iCalendar. In the Egroupware server we
are dealing with socalled "egw server" time, in applications that a
user of egw runs, the user can set a "locale" and thereby defining a
"local timezone". And finally when events and task get exported to an
iCalendar that is sent to a client or uploaded from  it, they may also
have their timesettings defined according to some "timezone".

How is this all handled in EgwIcal?



@section secegwicalgentzh EgwIcal general Timezone handling

In general EgwIcal distinguishes between two different types of time
descriptions for an event. An event can either be a:
<ul>
<li>
 DATETIME (DT) (described) event.

  In this case the occurence of the event is described as taking place
  on a certain day and within that day on a certain time.  E.g. <code>
  mon 12 june 2006 at 12:33 GMT+001 </code> Examples are: <i>the
  opening of the Olympic games</i>.

  DT events are thus absolute (in global world time) anchored in time:
  everyone watching live TV, anywhere in the world can see it happen
  at that same moment described by DT.
 
 Result is that a DT described event will occur at different hours or
 even days in different timezones. (Some people have to watch the
 Olympic game openings at night..)
 

<li>DATE (D) (described) events

  These events donot happen at an absolute global time but are only
  well defined relative to a  timezone.
  A good example is "your birthday" or "new years day".
  
  In principle this could be either <i>whole day</i> events (like
  birthdays) or events timed within days (like the "easter sunday
  service at 12:00").

</ul>


For handling DT events it can be profitable to use a globally unified standard
for describing the timingly definitions, like e.g. UTC. 
And indeed:
<ul>
<li>RE.0, REI.0 <b> Egw and EgwIcal try to handle DATE-TIME events in UTC.</b>

Or of course, equivalently, some (time + UTC offset)-pair description.
</ul>


For handling D events you can best give a (timezone/geo) relative
description together with the GEO location. Then someone who wants to
visit such a event can checkout the location and see what timezone
they have there at moment of the event, calculate it back to UTC and
then she knows when to get there.
Egw and EgwIcal are no very sophisticated in handling these:

- <b> RE.1 (I am not 100% sure:) Egw tries to handle DATE events relative to
  the UserInterface its timezone: the so called USER-TIME.</b>

and for EgwIcal:

- <b> REI.1  EgwIcal tries to handle DATE events relative to
  the UserInterface timezone (USER-TIME) of the IcalSrv proces of the
  logged in user.</b>

and keep in mind:

- <b> REI.2 EgwIcal currently will only import or export DATE events
  for <i>whole day</i> events or for <i>occurence settings of recurrent
  events</i> </b>

In the following sections I will explain a bit more what this means
for import of Ical data from clients and export to it.




@section secegwicalimptzh EgwIcal Timezone handling for icaldata import from a client.

.....

@subsection subsecvtmz VTIMEZONE import handling.

  No VTIMEZONE ical elements are parsed or used
  This has a consequence:

  - no basic import timezone setting via this supported

  - no imported timezones with identifiers that can be referenced by
    VEVENTS or VTODOS are supported

@subsection subsecdtimp DATETIME formatted data import handling.

  DATETIME formatted data is inspected for its timezone. If the
  timezone is UTC ('Z') then it is converted (i.e. copied) to UTC
  before processing further.  If the timezone is not given of is
  referenced with a key to a VTIMEZONE component in the Icalendar
  file, this timezone info is discarded and <b> a "timezoned" DATETIME
  is just interpreted as relative to the USERTIME of the IcalSrv
  process: any timezone info is neglected</b>. 

 Clearly this can be wrong in many occasions: thus this should be
 considered a BUG!

@subsection subsecdimp  DATE formatted data import handling.

  <b>DATE formatted data is  ust interpreted as relative to the USERTIME of the IcalSrv
  process: any timezone info is neglected</b>. 
  

@subsection subsecrruleimp Importing Recurrence Elements



  Doing recurrence calculation in UTC is notably not a good thing to
  do because DayTime Savings changes during the runtime of the
  recurring event can cause troubles. The best thing to do is to
  calculate the recurrence in the geo/time-zone of the definer. See
  @url ... of the CAlConnect Group for this. But as clients often dont
  export their timezones, (and we dont do any processing of it anyhow)
  we do the following:

<ol>
 <li> first the START and (if there UNTIL) dates are converted to UTC
  dates. Then these are converted to the IcalSrv locale setting.
 
 <li> Then the recurrence rules are evaluated, and converted to the info
  Egw needs. Note: Egw cannot use the COUNT field, so EgwIcal has to
  rewrite it to a UNTIL value.  
</ol>



@section secegwicalexptzh EgwIcal Timezone handling for icaldata export to a client.

On export ....

- all Egw DATETIME info is exported in UTC time.

- all Egw DATE info is exported without any timezone info,
  and thus should best be considered in the USERTIME of the IcalSrv
  process.


@subsection subsecrruleexp Exporting Recurrence Elements

On export Recurrence Rules are interpreted as follows:

<ul>
<li> the START date, if in DATE-TIME format is converted to UTC.
   If it is in DATE format exported right away, thus being in the
   IcalSrv local timezone: <b>this may be wrong, but best possible!</b>.

<li> If there, an UNTIL date this is exported as UTC
 
</ul>



Hope this explains things a bit.
