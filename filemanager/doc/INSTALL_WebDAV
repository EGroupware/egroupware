INSTALL : WebDAV file share
---------------------------
Note: if you don't know what WebDAV is you probably don't need it.  The default
vfs_sql is generally faster and easier to setup.

Filemanager's WebDAV support allows you to store your files online in 
phpgroupware, in a way that cooperates well with other web applications (for
instance, in Windows you can then access your files as a "web folder", and
similarly KDE, Gnome, MacOSX, and amultitude of applications (eg MS Office and
OpenOffice.org) all include some way of browsing files on a WebDAV share)


Installation
------------
To install:

1/	Setup a WebDAV server - currently this code has only been well tested using
	Apache's mod_dav (http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/).  mod_dav is included in
	Apache 2, and most Linux distributions include it as a package.

	To setup mod_dav ensure that you have the module installed correctly ( RTFM :)
	and create a virtual host (eg files.yourdomain.com) something like this:

		<VirtualHost files.yourdomain.com:80>
			AccessFileName .htaccess
			ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
			DocumentRoot /var/files
			<Location />
				AllowOverride All
				Options +Indexes
				DAV on
				DirectoryIndex /
				RemoveHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
				RemoveType application/x-httpd-php .php .php3
				RemoveType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
			</Location>
			<Files ~ "^\.ht">
				#This ensures phpgroupware can modify .htaccess files
				order deny,allow
				deny from all
				#make sure your phpgroupware server is included here.
				allow from localhost .localdomain
			</Files>
			ServerName files.yourdomain.com
			ErrorLog logs/dav_err
			CustomLog logs/dav_acc combined
		</VirtualHost>

2/	On the setup page (phpgroupware/setup/config.php) specify
	the WebDAV server URL (eg http://files.yourdomain.com ) in the: "Full path
	for users and groups files" text area, and select DAV in the:
	"Select where you want to store/retrieve filesystem information"
	combo.  If your file repository supports SSL you might want to enter
	'https://files.yourdomain.com' instead - note that phpGroupWare itself wont
	use SSL to access the repository, but when it redirects the users browser to
	the repository it will use the secure https url.

3/	Make sure your WebDAV repository contains a "home" directory (important!)
	So if your WebDAV directory is /var/files, you would need:
		/var/files/
		/var/files/home/

4/	(OPTIONAL) Ideally you want some kind of authentication on the WebDAV
	repository, so that users accessing it directly still need their phpgroupware
	password.
	To enable authentication you must use a third-party Apache authentication
	module.  Which you use depends on how you have setup authentication in
	phpGroupWare - for instance if you use an SQL DB (the default) then set up
	mod_auth_pgsql (http://www.giuseppetanzilli.it/mod_auth_pgsql/) or
	mod_auth_mysql (http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/)
	An example .htaccess file is included for postgresql - mysql would be
	similar. Your file repository also needs to be configured to allow
	phpGroupWare to write .htaccess files (the setup in (3) will allow this)

	Note that using an Apache module for authentication is not strictly
	required in order to use WebDAV within phpGroupWare.
